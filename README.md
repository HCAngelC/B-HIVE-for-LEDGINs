**Aim:** 

(1) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on the genes less frequenly targeted by HIV while the cells are treated with different concentrations of LEDGINs. 

(2) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on the genes targeted by HIV with no RNA barcodes detected.

**Results:**

(1)

(2) We did not detect any enriched KEGG pathways from the genes targeted by HIV without RNA expression in SupT1 cells treated with 6.25 µM (2X IC) and 31.25 µM (10X IC) in SupT1 cells; we did not detect any enriched KEGG pathways from the genes targeted by HIV without RNA expression in SupT1 cells in Jurkat T cells treated with 15.62 µM (5X IC).
